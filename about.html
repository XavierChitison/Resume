         <p>
        I am currently a college student working toward my A.A.S. in Software Development, a Bachelor’s in Computer Science, and eventually a Master’s in Software Engineering. For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved breaking things down, rebuilding them, and solving problems. Once I learned that this is exactly what engineers do, I knew I wanted to become one.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
          When I entered high school, I already knew I enjoyed problem-solving, but I wasn’t sure which field of engineering I wanted to pursue. During my sophomore year, I attended a two-week engineering career program at MSOE(Milwaukee School Of Engineering), where we had two four-hour classes each day taught by different instructors across multiple engineering fields. I found all of them interesting, but Software Engineering immediately stood out to me. The field matched everything I enjoyed—creating things, solving problems, and working with technology.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
           I’ve always been an internet-focused person, whether I was playing video games or researching things online, so I already understood the basics of computers. Around my junior year, I wanted to learn how to code, but my school didn’t offer any programming classes. Because of that, I turned to YouTube to figure out where to start. I discovered Swift, which seemed like a great language for app development, so I watched a lot of tutorials and became pretty decent at it.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
          During my senior year, I had a year-long Capstone project. My group decided to build a school loyalty rewards system app that would boost participation, support, and school spirit. However, no one else in the group knew how to code, and no one wanted to learn, so I ended up developing the entire app on my own. With sports and school on top of debugging long nights, I pushed through. I contacted companies for guidance, set up meetings, and sought mentors to support our project. The hard work paid off—our app won a national award, and each member of our group received $1,000. I was also featured on the news to explain the app and how it worked.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
         Because of my skills, I earned a full-tuition scholarship to a local college, and now I am working toward achieving all my degrees. If there is one thing my story shows, it’s that I am committed, hardworking, and determined to finish what I start. Most people would have quit, but once I set my eyes on something, I pursue it until I achieve it.
